Scouter is an app to help people navigate the confusing and chaotic world of e-scooters and e-bikes. I got the idea for this app from a friend of mine, Adam, who used e-scooters as his primary way to get to work everyday. 

He was tired of checking many different apps to find the closest scooter. I developed an app that plotted Bird, Lime, Jump, and Lyft scooters and bikes in the Los Angeles area. Obtaining access to the location APIs of each scooter was quite an adventure. I emailed City Council, who had made location API access a necessary part of approving scooter programs, pretending to study scooter movement and got access to Lime's location API. I found Bird's location API on another github page, and I found Jump and Lyft's by monitoring the packets coming from my phone to the internet when I launched their apps. This also involved a little guess work, but it ultimately worked out. Sadly, most of the companies have changed their API configuration by this point, but I've included a screenshot of what the app looked like when it was working at different stages of development. I stopped working on the app when I discovered that I had been beat to market by another app.
