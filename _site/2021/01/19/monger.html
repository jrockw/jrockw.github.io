        <p>During the long months of quarentine, I cofounded, led, designed, and built Monger.la, LLC, a food delivery service with an ecommerce platform and an order management system.</p>

<p>Restauraunts had been shut down in California’s first lockdown and the wholesale food system was struggling. Distributors began selling directly to consumers via email. I saw a market for an ecommerce platform for these distributors, the status quo was sloppy and inefficient. I partnerned with a team and got to work. I was in charge of creating the platform, and I began by meeting with distributors and learning about their efficiencies and bottlenecks. I realized that efficient routing of delivery trucks had been a big problem for most of these distributors that had been used to driving to the same restraurants week after week. I noted that processing payment and communication with customers took at least one person working full time. Orders were assembled in a very specific way, and the pace was fast.</p>

<p>With all these observations in mind, I began designing the platform and order management system. I used django-oscar, an ecommerce plugin for Django and customized order flow, inventory management, checkout flow, payment processing, and many more aspects. I brought on a front end developer, who I managed. Managing someone else was an incredibly challanging and rewarding experience. I noticed I needed to be explicit about what I wanted built and I needed to track our progress as the todo list became unwieldy. I used Jira to set up a Kanban board, and prioritized our tasks. I really liked the distributed way I was able to order the tasks, and the focus on achieving a minimum viable product.</p>

<p>As I met with graphic designers, distributors, and business partners, I had to learn to balance competing desires from growing feature requests, to testing the platform, while keeping to a fast paced timeline. Lots of this project required learning entirely new areas of software development, from database management, to AWS hosting and security, to web app production.</p>

<p>I enjoyed creating fixes to problems that distributors spent 30+ hrs/week on. Talking with one distributor, I found that he spent ~1 hour a day plotting delivery routes for his drivers on google maps. I recalled the traveling salesman problem from a Discrete Math course I took, and wrote a program that would find an optimal solution, given average traffic times, distance, distribution point, and time contraints. I was able to integrate this program with django so that when we were ready to submit an order sheet to a distributor, a delivery route would be automatically generated.</p>

<p>As we entered the Alpha phase of testing, the importance of creating a fully tested platform became apparent. I found bugs where I didn’t know they could have existed. I had to review the frontend developer’s work, and decided that a style guide would be beneficial. I knew that I would be going back to school where I wouldn’t be able to continue to work on the project, so I took the opportunity to create a wiki as well with documentation for the platform. Once enough bugs were fixed, we moved to a beta phase.</p>

<p>In the beta phase we began to place orders with distributors, using a small group of friends and family as customers. The little things, like creating a “Forgot password” or site map rose out of the barrage of testers. At this point, I had to go back to school. I had essentialy taken a semester off already, and intend on graduating in a semi-timely manner. I negotiated a sale of my position and the product I’d made to my partners, and drove out to Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>During this three month long sprint, I’d learned a lot about myself as a developer. I found that I really liked managing projects, and floating from issue to issue. Creating a product was an entirely different experience than a side project or school assignment. I enjoyed the fast pace required and the real world impact, being able to manage and design customer informed products.</p>
