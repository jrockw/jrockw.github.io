        <h2><a href="/2020/07/24/instanet.html">Instanet</a></h2>
        <p>An experiment into scraping instagram to build a facial recognition network trained across everyone’s instagram pages that I follow. There were two main challanges: low shot recognition and identifying the face of the owner of a given page. Low shot recognitoin was difficult because normally CNNs require vast amounts of data to train, most people only have a handfull of pictures on their instagram pages. I overcame this by using a Siamese Neural Network, a network that has been pre-trained on millions of faces and identifies the useful features in distinguishing a given face. When a face is fed into the network, the result is a vector of 128 useful features. The second major challenge was identifying the owner of a given page. People post photos of others, group photos, and memes. To determine which faces belonged to the owner of the page, I used a clustering algorithm to find which faces in someone’s profile appeared the most frequently. Then these vectors of people’s facial features were added to a database I used to later identify them from the wild.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/05/14/scouter.html">Scouter</a></h2>
        <p>Scouter is an app to help people navigate the confusing and chaotic world of e-scooters and e-bikes. I got the idea for this app from a friend of mine, Adam, who used e-scooters as his primary way to get to work everyday. He was tired of checking many different apps to find the closest scooter. I developed an app that plotted Bird, Lime, Jump, and Lyft scooters and bikes in the Los Angeles area. Obtaining access to the location APIs of each scooter was quite an adventure. I emailed City Council, who had made location API access a necessary part of approving scooter programs, pretending to study scooter movement and got access to Lime’s location API. I found Bird’s location API on another github page, and I found Jump and Lyft’s by monitoring the packets coming from my phone to the internet when I launched their apps. This also involved a little guess work, but it ultimately worked out. Sadly, most of the companies have changed their API configuration by this point, but I’ve included a screenshot of what the app looked like when it was working at different stages of development. I stopped working on the app when I discovered that I had been beat to market by another app.</p>
