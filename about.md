# About me

I'm Jacob Rockwell, a student at the University of Michigan, an entrepeneur, a sailor, a cinephile, a surfer,  a fisherman, an electrician, a surfboard repairman, and a freelance web developer. I'm an aspiring polymath. As I work toward becoming a master of all trades, I explore the complexity of problems around me. I've used my last year in college to explore machine learning, specifically in computer vision. I'm currently working on learning to create deepfake videos and creating a program to count surfers in webcam footage.
