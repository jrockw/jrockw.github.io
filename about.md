# About me

I'm Jacob Rockwell, a student at the University of Michigan, an entrepeneur, a sailor, a cinephile, a surfer, and developer. I'm an aspiring polymath. I've used my last year in college to explore computer vision in machine learning. I'm currently working on learning to create deepfake videos and creating a program to count surfers in webcam footage. When I'm offline, I'm either in the water or preparing a boat to sail to Mexico. I'm currently looking for internships for the summer.
